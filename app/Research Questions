3. How to implement the RXJava Map and FlatMap.


4. The difference in map vs flatmap
The map operator applies a function of your choosing to each item emitted by the source Observable,
and returns an Observable that emits the results of these functions applications.

The Flatmap operator transforms an Observable by applying a function that you specify to each item emitted by the
source Observable, where that functions returns an Observable that itself emits items.

5. What are hot and cold observables.
Hot observables are close over external data producers.
Cold observables are observables that run their sequence when and if they are subscribed to.
